- [WWW 2024] [Self-Guided Robust Graph Structure Refinement](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3589334.3645522) propose to extract clean subgraphs and refine the extracted graph structure by leveraging both topological and feature similarity. Additionally, it employ a degree-based group training strategy to address the unbalanced degree distribution.[[Code](https://github.com/yeonjun-in/torch-SG-GSR)]
